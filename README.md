I successfully completed an R project 📊🔬 on yearly deaths, including data collection, cleaning, and visualization using world graphs 🌍📈 and bar plots 📊📊 in a Shiny app. The project also considered GDP and population for each year. 💪💻
I collected accurate and reliable death data from various sources and performed meticulous data cleaning operations. 🧹✨
Using R's powerful graphing capabilities, I created world graphs showcasing global mortality trends over the years. These visually striking graphs allowed easy comparison between regions and countries. 🌍📈
Additionally, I designed bar plots that illustrated the relationship between deaths, GDP, and population for each year. By incorporating these variables, I aimed to uncover potential correlations or patterns. 📊📈🌍
To enhance accessibility and interactivity, I developed a Shiny app. This user-friendly web application allowed dynamic exploration of the data and visualizations. Users could select specific years, regions, or countries to view corresponding graphs, bar plots, and statistics. 🌐📲
In summary, my successful R project involved data collection, cleaning, and visualization of yearly deaths using world graphs and bar plots. The project also integrated GDP and population data, providing comprehensive insights into mortality rates and their potential relationships with economic and demographic factors. The inclusion of a Shiny app enhanced accessibility and user engagement. 🎉🔍
